# EDH Group Rules

A collection of group rules that we have decided on.

The goals of these rules are:

1. Limit the power level
2. Have fun

## Extra Turns

* No extra turns

## Game Changers

* No game changers

## Infinite Combos

* No 2-card infinite combos

## Land Denial

* No mass land denial

Etiquette: When destroying a land, prioritize ones with non-mana abilities or effects.

## Saltiness

* Avoid cards that can completely shutdown certain archetypes e.g. Scavenger Grounds > Rest in Peace
* Avoid cards that slow down the game (stax) or that you wouldnâ€™t enjoy playing against yourself

## Tutors

* Only tutor for Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, Swamp, or Wastes cards

## Enforcement

These rules are meant as guidelines; if you play a card that breaks one, just be ready for some light roasting.
